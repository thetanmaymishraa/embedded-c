## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Basic understanding of the C programming language.
- Familiarity with microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, STM32, AVR, PIC, ESP32).
- Basic knowledge of electronic components and circuits.

## Project List
Here are some basic embedded C projects included in this repository:

1. **LED Blinking** – The "Hello World" of embedded systems.
2. **Button Controlled LED** – Learn how to read digital inputs.
3. **Temperature Sensor (LM35/DHT11) Interface** – Read temperature data.
4. **Ultrasonic Sensor for Distance Measurement** – Measure distances using HC-SR04.
5. **LCD Display Interface** – Display text on a 16x2 LCD.
6. **Servo Motor Control** – Control servo motor position using PWM.
7. **I2C and SPI Communication** – Interface with external peripherals.
8. **UART Communication** – Serial communication between microcontroller and PC.
9. **Real-Time Clock (RTC) Module Interface** – Read time and date from an RTC.
10. **Basic Home Automation** – Control relays with a microcontroller.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the projects:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/embedded-c-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd embedded-c-projects
   ```
3. Open the source code in an IDE such as Keil, MPLAB, Arduino IDE, STM32CubeIDE, or PlatformIO.
4. Compile and upload the code to the microcontroller.
5. Observe the output on the hardware setup.

## Required Hardware
Depending on the project, you may need:
- Microcontroller board (e.g., Arduino, STM32, ESP32, AVR, PIC, etc.)
- LEDs, resistors, and push buttons
- Sensors (LM35, DHT11, HC-SR04, etc.)
- LCD display (16x2 with I2C or parallel interface)
- Servo motors and relays
- Jumper wires and a breadboard

## Software Setup
To develop and upload embedded C programs, you need:
- **IDE/Compiler**: Arduino IDE, Keil, MPLAB X, STM32CubeIDE, or VS Code with PlatformIO.
- **Programmers/Debuggers**: USB-to-serial converter, ST-Link, AVRISP, etc.
- **Libraries & Drivers**: Install necessary libraries for peripherals (e.g., Adafruit sensor libraries for Arduino).
